Bolts are self propelled, armor piercing rounds with a mass-reactive fuse and high explosive filler.
They pierce their target before exploding, maximizing the damage of their warhead and
gruesomely blowing their apart target from the inside out. There are few types of personal 
armor that can defeat bolter rounds; even Astartes power armor will quickly fail under 
a hail of bolts. 

Metalstorm rounds sacrifice armor piercing capability for a fragmentation warhead, making
them effective against hordes of soft targets.

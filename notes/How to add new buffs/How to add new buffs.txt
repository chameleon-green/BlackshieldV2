0. There can only be so many active effects at once as determined by obj_ic
-Max_Buffs_Amount determines hard limit on max simultaneous buffs. Any higher than this and the game crashes
-The other limit is the detection code in the obj_ic begin step event. If you exceed the limit here, the buff will be infinite
  in duration as the timer is never started

1. Update scr_boon_activate to make game understand what the buff actually does

2. Update health icon object's step event to detect and create status icons


-scr_aid_use: function to inject variables into object, shouldn't have to ever modify this when adding new buffs
-scr_boon_activate: does the actual actions, update when new buff is added

	Obj_enemy_bullet collision line functionality not working (?)
	Issue ID'd: checking when to reaccelerate round is impairing functionality
	
	Weird fix described in obj_enemy_bullet: on impact, projectile slows down to allow
	for hit registration and ignores col_list id check entirely (original goal was to 
	let bullet detect what it already had already hit and then ignore it and keep moving, now 
	bullet slows down and hit object recognizes which bullet has already hit it)

-4/24/2020 [UNFIXED]
	Heavy attack swing includes gun anim for some reason?
	
	
-8/2/2020 [MOST LIKELY FIXED]
	memory leaks from ds_maps and lists not being destroyed, enemy and impact code being huge offenders
	not impact code! enemy code is flawed, ENEMY IMPACT CODE is not deleting lists and a few grids. See profiler for all calls
	
-1/10/2021 [FIXED]
	ramps are generally buggy
	enemies killed in mid air do weird shit, floating around and not playing death animation 
	FIXED: disabled walking/sprinting when dead. gravity was tied to astar pathing as well.
	
-1/14/2021 [FIXED]
	scrolling with mousewheel in inventory when fully zoomed in cuts of bottom inventory item
	when clicking and dragging scrollbar, bug does not occur
